Hi, I'm Rui Wang. I'm an international Ph.D. candidate at the School of Population Health in the University of Auckland. I love the multicultural inclusiveness of New Zealand and hope to be a grounded theory scholar in the New Zealand way. I'm interested to hear about a variety of views and perspectives from people in New Zealand to expand my knowledge. I am passionate about supporting the wellbeing of people, hence my research into the role of mHealth technologies in supporting physical activity related to a healthy body weight. This is important research in the developed world where food maybe abundant and where work and leisure are increasingly sedentary. I aim to develop a theory about the relationships between mHealth technologies, physical activity, and healthy body weight, to support people to better manage their wellness.
