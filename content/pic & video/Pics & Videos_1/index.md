## I love the moments when sending gift cards to my participants.

The best part of doing research is keeping a journal of the little things that happen each day; I believe that looking back on those entries will be a treasure trove of information once I reach the summit and reflect on my journey from there.

If you would like to participate in this research, just follow [**this link**](https://auckland.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bOfETKNZCCuHHjo) to find more information and complete the registration. Thank you!
