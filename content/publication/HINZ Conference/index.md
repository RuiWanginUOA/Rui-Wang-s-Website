abstract: 
Intro- Excess weight issues, including overweight and obesity, can be referred to as an epidemic worldwide and in New Zealand. It can be linked to the causes of chronic diseases, mental and psychosocial adverse consequences. 
As a key component of lifestyle intervention, increasing PA has been shown to alleviate morbidity effectively and contributes to preventing excess weight issue. However, the current participation of the population's PA is not promising. Also, PA is a complex and dynamic behavioral state that varies according to the unique habits of the individual. Therefore, it is possible that a generic theoretical model of behavior intervention fails to consider the complexity and specificity of various contexts. 
Over the last two decades, mHealth technology has become more widely used and provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional weight-loss programmes for those who need support losing weight but cannot otherwise achieve it. Current qualitative studies have mostly focused on users' preferences, viewpoints, and experiences on the functional features of mHealth in weight management. 
Therefore, an in-depth, substantive, GT based research based on the experiences of adults in New Zealand who have used mHealth in an attempt to lose weight and/or shape PA habits should have the potential for application.

Method- As this is the first stage of the whole study, the aim is to explore the nature of using mHealth to support PA from the point of view of people who want to lose weight. A constructivist GTM fits epistemologically and with the focus on the social processes of this study. Participants aged over 18 years, identify themselves as having long-term weight issues or concerns, are able to recall their experiences or perspectives of using mobile technology to engage in PA, are able to speak English, and have lived in New Zealand for at least six months were purposively selected. They were guided to complete an online registration process and interviewed face-to-face or online using a semi-structured approach. Each interview was transcribed verbatim and being processed using NVivo 2020. An iterative inductive coding procedure and constant comparison were used. Sampling and analysis stopped after 15 interviews when theoretical saturation was reached.

Results- The preliminary results of the study we got so far are as follows,
Demographic data show that eight participants were female; ages ranged from 18 to 61 years; eight reported having a BMI of 25 or above; 14 participants were of European or Asian descent. Most participants had kept track of their PA with at least two techniques for one to five years. Respondents rated mHealth's success at increasing PA and improving overall wellness at 69.27. 
Key concepts that emerged from the data were classified into four themes and nine categories.

Motivation- Motivations are categorized as intrinsic and external factors. 
An individual's intrinsic motives are the primary engines of behavior, which include body weight concerns, emerging concerns about losing weight, and a sense of lifestyle change. Participants in this study all described a prolonged, multifaceted combination of weight concerns. Most participants mentioned they intended to keep their weight within a healthy range by engaging in PA and creating healthier lifestyle habits. 
Participantsâ€™ attitudes toward mHealth determined their external motivation factors. They generally endorsed the development and accessibility of mHealth technologies for tracking PA. Notably, mHealth provided a major external contribution to people's home-based PA monitoring during the Covid-19 lockdown. 

PA Behavioral Responses- The process of using mHealth to support PA was a dynamic continuum. We can see from the figure here, participants adopted diverse behavioral responses and represented different levels in terms of mHealth engagement and PA participation (people defined their success of PA participation as whether they incorporated PA into a long-term lifestyle routine).
Behavioral responses include two main categories- forming behavioral routines and behavior changes. Forming behavioral routines were described as developing a fixed PA routine, remaining accountable to increase their daily PA, continuously tracking progress to keep motivated, establishing a doable, sequential PA mode, taking actions to improve PA effectiveness, and modifying current PA routines based on past record keeping. 
The process of forming PA behavioral routines is not linear; situational shifts (e.g., seasonal change, gym closures), cognitive value changes (e.g., not wanting to remain immobilized, awareness of changing current lifestyles), and uncontrollable variables (e.g., pandemic lockdowns, experiencing physical illness) affected participants' behavioral responses from time to time, which leads to changes in behavior. For instance, people would leverage mHealth resources to improve their motivation or reformulate an actionable PA plan and take alternative actions.
While in this study, a category of desensitization effect was emerged, which means that although mHealth was considered a starting motivation for PA, after establishing certain behavioral routines, they chose not to be reliant on using mHealth to monitor their PA. Still, the behavior was retained and potentially had a long-lasting influence on lifestyle habits.

MHealth Evaluation- Most participants conveyed a favorable attitude towards incorporating mHealth into their PA routines. Key mHealth roles included getting motivated to be physically active, establishing a benchmark or goal with tracked data, accountable adherence to PA routines, and empowering autonomy in maintaining healthy lifestyles. 
However, they also adopted a skeptical posture toward the possible risks associated with an electronics-based approach. These risks involve mHealth addiction or abuse, increased psychological strain and weariness, lack of tailoring of mHealth interventions for multicultural groups for equity, and the validity and reliability of mHealth measurements.

Social Interaction- Engagement in mHealth seems to be reinforcing and providing opportunities for people to interact in their social context and can help establish positive interconnection. Some participants described their PA interaction as not being a solitary journey. Family and close friends were the most involved parties. From neutral to positive responses were mentioned when participants attempted to share their preferred mHealth activity with them. 
When participants talked about whether they would be open to posting their PA outcomes or progress publicly, most expressed negative willingness. More participants were concerned about the potentially harmful nature of social media, and they indicated that their use of mHealth was private and they did not want to be judged. Despite this aversion to mHealth and sharing data via social media, creating healthy PA competition and sharing PA progress among peers was considered acceptable by some participants.

Conclusion- The results of this study in relation to the use of mHealth to lose weight or shape PA habits provides a preliminary conceptualization framework for proposing a researcher-constructed GT. In the next stage, we'll delve further into 1) existing findings, to inform the second round of convergent interviewing and guide the emergence of new interview questions that will be applied to the in-depth theory building process; 2) most participants had previously dabbled with different mHealth technologies due to the present study's purposive sampling method. As they seem to be a health-conscious and passionate group, this raises concerns about sampling bias. Given this, theoretical sampling will be the focus for the next phase of this study.
